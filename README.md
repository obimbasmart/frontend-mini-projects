# Frontend Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small front-end projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
These projects are the result of completing challenges from websites like Frontend Mentor and DevChallenges. 
Each project is designed to demonstrate my web development skills and fulfill specific user stories and requirements.


## About the Challenges

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home)  and [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) are platforms that provide web development challenges and designs for developers to practice and showcase their skills.
These challenges often come with user stories, design mockups, and sometimes starter code.
