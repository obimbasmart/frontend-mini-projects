## Key Learning
In this project, I employed JavaScript to infuse interactivity into the webpage through DOM manipulation techniques. It was a delightful experience witnessing the webpage come alive with interactive elements.

Furthermore, I acquired knowledge in utilizing localStorage to store small key-value pairs, enhancing the user's browsing experience.

Additionally, I harnessed the power of CSS and variables to establish a consistent design approach, eliminating the need for repetitive code while maintaining uniformity in colors and sizes throughout the project.
