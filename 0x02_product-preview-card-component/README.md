### Key Learning

In this specific project, I acquired proficiency in employing CSS media queries to ensure webpage responsiveness, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes and devices

The `@media` at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.

In the below example the padding is applied to the .card class when the viewport is 960px wide and below.

```css
.@media (max-width: 960px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
```
